 * What is Closure?
 * A closure is the coombination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to it's surrounding state (the lexical environment)
 * In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function. In JavaScript. closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time
